POOPYPANTS.NET
================

On September 25th, 2008, I was visiting my brother and sister-in-law in Portland, Oregon. I had to poop, as I am wont to do, so I went to the bathroom like any normal dude. While washing my hands I noticed a peculiar little chart that had been taped on the wall next to the mirror.

As I was drying my hands off, I scanned the chart and figured out my new name according to Professor Poopypants: [Crusty Bubbletush](http://poopypants.net/eli/duke). I chuckled to myself and then grabbed my camera.

I took [a photo of that chart](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elisfanclub/2908192137/), and it is now my most popular photo on Flickr, with over 12,000 views. I realize that is not a whole lot of views, but it is still **my most popular photo**. Of all the 40,000 photos that I've uploaded to Flickr, why the heck do so many people care about Professor Poopypants's Pocket-Sized "Name Change-O-Chart 2000"?

I have no idea how that photo got so much Google Juice, but I still think Professor Poopypants is pretty darn funny. It's rare when I figure out someone's new name and don't crack a smile at least. Sometimes I laugh out loud! I wanted to be able to quickly share these funny little names with friends online, but the [Official Professor Poopypants Website](http://www.scholastic.com/captainunderpants/poopypants.htm) is not very helpful.

I felt a hole in my soul growing larger.

In January 2012 I decided it was time to take action. As an exercise to improve my Ruby chops, I turned that little chart into a [bonafide ruby script](https://github.com/eliduke/Professor-Poopypants-Name-Change-O-Ruby-Script-2000). That script got things going in the right direction, but it wasn't good enough. A few days later I registered http://poopypants.net and it gets ~1000 page views per month, which I think is pretty cool for a website about poopypants.

In January 2017 I was poking around some of my old projects and decided it was time to pull out the brains of this site and put them into the [poopypants Ruby Gem](https://github.com/eliduke/poopypants). It was my first real foray into the world of building Ruby Gems, but it is a pretty simple so it was a good place to start. Rest assured that poopypants.net is now rocking the new poopypants Ruby Gem.

You're welcome, Internet.
